Certainly! Here's the **markdown (md)** version of the process steps:

### Steps to Communicate and Explain the System (Advanced Signage System)

1. **System Overview and Context Definition**
   - Define the overall purpose of the system, key stakeholders, and high-level functionality.
   - Provide an overview of the main components, platforms, and target users.
   - **Output**: `System Overview Document`, `Context Diagram`

2. **Functional Requirements Specification**
   - Define the main system functions (advertisement management, layout creation, synchronization, etc.).
   - Break down into specific use cases (e.g., designer creating layouts, user interacting with plugins).
   - **Output**: `Use Case Diagrams`, `Functional Specification Document`

3. **Non-Functional Requirements**
   - Specify performance, scalability, availability, security, and cross-platform compatibility requirements.
   - List platform-specific requirements (Windows, Linux, Android, iOS).
   - **Output**: `Non-Functional Requirements Document`

4. **High-Level System Architecture**
   - Define the major architectural components (client apps, server, plugins, etc.).
   - Identify system boundaries, data flow, and external interfaces.
   - **Output**: `High-Level Architecture Diagram`, `Component Interaction Diagram`

5. **Detailed System Design**
   - Break down each major component into smaller subsystems/modules (e.g., layout management, synchronization).
   - Identify external APIs, database, communication protocols, etc.
   - Specify design patterns (MVC, plugin system, etc.) and how they will be implemented.
   - **Output**: `Detailed Design Document`, `Class Diagrams`, `Data Flow Diagrams`

6. **Integration Strategy**
   - Define how different modules interact and integrate.
   - Determine data synchronization protocols and inter-device communication.
   - Specify cross-platform libraries and tools.
   - **Output**: `Integration Diagram`, `Sequence Diagrams`

7. **Plugin Architecture**
   - Specify how plugins can be added dynamically without modifying the core system.
   - Define the plugin interfaces and extensibility mechanisms.
   - **Output**: `Plugin Architecture Document`, `Interface Definition`

8. **Technical Stack and Environment Setup**
   - List technologies (Flutter, Electron, etc.), frameworks, libraries, and any third-party services.
   - Define platform-specific technical stack.
   - **Output**: `Technical Stack Document`, `Setup Instructions`

9. **Security and Data Protection Design**
   - Define how user data is handled securely.
   - Specify authentication, authorization, and encryption mechanisms.
   - **Output**: `Security Design Document`

10. **Testing and Validation**
    - Define testing strategy for functionality, performance, cross-platform behavior, and integration.
    - Specify automated test plans and manual testing scenarios.
    - **Output**: `Test Plan Document`, `Test Cases`

11. **Deployment Strategy**
    - Define deployment processes for server and client apps.
    - Plan for updating layouts/plugins and synchronizing them across devices.
    - **Output**: `Deployment Document`

12. **Maintenance and Extensibility Plan**
    - Define the approach for updating the system and adding new features/plugins.
    - Specify how new clients/platforms can be supported in the future.
    - **Output**: `Maintenance Plan Document`

### Flowchart of the Process

In this case, some steps can be done in parallel. Below is a simplified flowchart of the process in markdown.
